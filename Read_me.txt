This is just an example of a responsive web page that was made using only css and no more than five lines of jquery. There is also no
content on the actual web page. As far as other elements in html are concerned, I only added enough css to make a responsive layout 
so elements that are not in the "style.html" will not be addressed in the "style.css". Hope this helps.
